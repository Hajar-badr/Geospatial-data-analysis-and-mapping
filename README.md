# Geospatial Analysis and Healthcare Accessibility in Normandy

This project explores healthcare accessibility in the Normandy region by combining geospatial data, statistical methods, and travel time modeling. Using real-world datasets and road networks, we aim to identify territorial inequalities in access to care facilities.

 **Access to healthcare should not depend on a postal code.**  
Yet in Normandy, as in other regions, significant disparities persist. This study uses innovative tools and methods to map these gaps and propose actionable insights for policymakers.

##  Objectives

- Analyze healthcare access times across the Normandy region
- Identify underserved areas where travel time exceeds 30 minutes
- Explore potential solutions: hospital network optimization, road improvements, telemedicine

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** & **R** for data analysis and modeling
- **Geospatial libraries**: GeoPandas, Folium, Cartopy
- **Open datasets** on medical infrastructure and roads
